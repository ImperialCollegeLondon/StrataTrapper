%---------UPSCALED PARAMETERS----------
%Homogenising subvolume sizes. Here Nx is the size of the sub volume in voxels. number of CMG coarse cells in each direction - upscaled parameters (our upscaled grid size). Upscaling parameters. Sub values are the number of fine scale grid cells in each upscaled subvolume.

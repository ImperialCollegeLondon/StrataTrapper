## How to use

First, click [Use this template][github-use-template]
to make your own repository from this template.
Clone your new repository.

Then locally:

1. **Run [`init`](./init.m)** function for cleanup
2. **Upload your own MATLAB code**
3. Change anything else to you liking
4. Commit changes [appropriately][conventional-commits] along the way

Then, in _Settings â€” **Actions** â€” General_ of your repository:

1. [x] _Allow all actions and reusable workflows_
2. [x] _Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests_

You can also import a pre-built [**ruleset**](.github/rules/main.json) to protect
`main` branch from accidental unwanted hard-to-recover changes.\
In _Settings â€” Rules â€” Rulesets_ of your repository:

1. Click _New ruleset â€” Import a ruleset_
2. Upload [`.github/rules/main.json`](.github/rules/main.json)
3. Modify if needed and save

Then push the local changes and carry on with the development
of your freshly established public MATLAB project!
